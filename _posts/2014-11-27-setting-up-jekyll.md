# Setting up Jekyll on this site

([everything you need to know about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/))

Nothing out of the ordinary about the instructions until I got to how to deploy to gh-pages. The [jekyll githubpages instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) were lacking in detail. I gave up and installed the [Jekyll Site Automated Deployer to Github Pages](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy). Worked like a charm.

Next I need to figure out how to deploy from github itself...
